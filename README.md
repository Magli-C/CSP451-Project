## Assignment Overview

## Part A: Different visual cues when pushing and force-pushing exists to bring notice to the seriousness of overwriting the remote repo, deleting what is currently on the remote repository with your own 
## edits might cause issues if working with others

## Part B: The color is green this is to symbolize success. Resetting thelocal comit works because you are discarding your changes locally and taking the remote, 
## the impact is has on the local branch is discarding all the changes you made that differ from the remote.

## Part C: During the merge process i deciced to accept all changes together. This was to have all the information in one file. Depending on the content this is not good because
## if you are using code you can have 2 sets of code doing the same thing or 2 parts of coding not working with each other

## Part D: The pull request process is important because you do not want to change the main branch with specific code when working with others if they have added code that would conflict,
## having multiple people view the code first before deciding to add it to main can solve problems where people will try to run main and not understand the changes  made

## Part E: Automation can help with many things like sending notifications when code has changed. Automating tasks like this reduces the time taken to better spend on other non menial tasks.
